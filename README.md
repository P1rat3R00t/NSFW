## üß† Threat Landscape Overview: Fileless Malware & LOLBins

**Fileless malware** operates exclusively in memory, avoiding disk writes to evade antivirus and EDR solutions. Leveraging trusted system binaries, attackers can bypass defenses without dropping a traditional file-based payload. These attacks often chain together native tools, scripts, and in-memory injection, leaving minimal forensic traces.

**LOLBins** (Living Off the Land Binaries) are legitimate Windows binaries repurposed by adversaries for malicious activity. Since they‚Äôre signed and trusted, many defenses overlook them. Abuse of LOLBins is a common red team tactic mapped extensively in the [MITRE ATT\&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.

# TeamViewer as a RAT: Summary

TeamViewer, a popular remote desktop application, can be misused as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) primarily by exploiting weak configurations, credential theft, or known vulnerabilities in its software versions. Attackers who gain access to valid credentials or exploit unpatched CVEs (such as DLL injection or privilege escalation flaws) can silently control a target system remotely, execute arbitrary commands, and move laterally within networks. This misuse leverages TeamViewer‚Äôs legitimate remote control capabilities to maintain persistent, stealthy access without triggering typical malware defenses. However, turning TeamViewer into a RAT requires either compromising authentication or exploiting vulnerabilities in older or unpatched versions, highlighting the importance of strong credential management and timely software patching.

To execute an embedded folder.7z as a fileless dropper via remote rundll32, you generally need to consider the following steps and relevant scripts from the ones you mentioned:

### Breakdown of the .ps1 Files in the Repo

1. **build_sfx.ps1**  
   - Creates a self-extracting archive (SFX) from your payload files (like DLLs, batch files) using 7z.

2. **dropper.ps1**  
   - Performs checks, downloads, and executes further scripts or payloads, often with obfuscation.

3. **loader.ps1**  
   - Downloads a DLL to memory, loads it via reflection, and invokes a method (no disk writes for the DLL).

### What You Need for a Fileless Dropper via Remote rundll32

If your objective is to execute a DLL payload filelessly (i.e., never writing the DLL to disk) using something like remote rundll32, the **minimum requirement** is:

- A script that can:
  1. Download the DLL (possibly from within an archive or directly).
  2. Load the DLL into memory.
  3. Invoke the desired function via reflection or in-memory execution.

#### From the scripts above:
- **loader.ps1** is the key script for true fileless DLL execution. It handles downloading the DLL, loading it into memory, and running it — all without touching disk.

- **build_sfx.ps1** is only needed if you want to distribute your payload as a self-extracting archive. It’s not required for execution if you already have the DLL hosted somewhere.

- **dropper.ps1** is a more complex script that could be used for initial access, environment checks, payload staging, and obfuscated execution. It can act as a first-stage dropper.

### Minimal Setup for Fileless Execution
- **You only need loader.ps1** for a fileless remote rundll32-style execution, provided:
  - loader.ps1 is delivered and executed in-memory (for example, via PowerShell remoting, an injected PowerShell runspace, or another dropper).
  - The DLL can be downloaded from a remote URL and never touches disk.

### Optional/Recommended
- Use **dropper.ps1** if you need staging, checks, or multi-stage payload delivery.
- **build_sfx.ps1** is only needed if you want to wrap everything into a single .exe archive for traditional execution.

**Summary:**  
You only need **loader.ps1** for a minimal, fileless, remote DLL execution (rundll32-style). The other scripts are for payload packaging or staging and are optional depending on your attack chain.
